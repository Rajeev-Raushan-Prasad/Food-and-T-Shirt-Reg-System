            NITT has always believed in the philosophy that the development of an 
            individual is not accomplished through pedantic learning alone but should 
            be complimented by a healthy dose of co-curricular and extra curricular activities too. 
            The foremost example of this philosophy is 'NITTFEST' - an annual extravaganza of fine arts!
        </p>
        <p>
            During NITTFEST, departments square off against each other over two days, on an even keel, 
            to battle over quizzes, debates, music, terpischorean delights and more - small battles fought 
            under the umbrella of a big war. A war which shall on a pleasant Sunday evening, determine the 
            best of them all. It is during such battles that the ceiling of belonging to the department merges 
            and grows to its zenith. a time when heros emerge in all, heartbreak for some, ecstasy for others, 
            but glory for the college and a treat for all.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is thus evident that NITTFEST is more than just a fest - it is in effect, a tribute to the creative 
            genius inherent in every Nittian. In keeping with its tradition, the high standards of NITTFEST assure 
            the sponsor a high degree of exposure, one that spans a community of over 3000.
