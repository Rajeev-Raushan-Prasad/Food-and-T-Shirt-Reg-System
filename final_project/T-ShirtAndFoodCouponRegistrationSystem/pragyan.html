            Five years back, in the portals of this very institution, the staff and students put their heads together 
            to come up with a vent for their creative outbursts. Pragyan’05 took shape in its maiden year as a technical 
            festival attracting innovation from across the state. The college took the promise of handing the torch down 
            every year with a commitment to the highest levels of quality in the event.

            Pragyan launched itself to the international arena with participating teams from over 60 countries taking 
            part in the online programming contests. With a host of 25 events spanning across 11 genres, Pragyan ’07 
            presented an opportunity to innovate. Innovate with creativity. Innovate for the betterment of life. 
            Innovate for the country’s progress and development. And while innovation is not separate from technology, 
            thus lays the need to know technology, use technology and celebrate technology. Pragyan ’07 gave the call to
            celebrate technology, to celebrate talent, to celebrate innovation. There were almost 700 volunteers working 
            in tandem to make this event a grand success.

            The participation from other college students has increased drastically and was close to 350 on campus students.
            Also there were online events like byte code and technical quiz and dalal street that went online to evoke 
            interest in people from all over the world. This year’s winners were from China and European countries.
