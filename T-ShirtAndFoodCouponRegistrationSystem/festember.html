            Festember is the inter college cultural, literary and arts extravaganza 
            of our college held usually in September. Misconstrued as a "fest in September", 
            the actual origins of Festember is "A fest to remember". The fest has college 
            students in South India swarming over to compete for the coveted Festember Rolling Trophy.

            One of the major highlights of Festember has been the pro-nites which have seen celebrity 
            bands come down and rock the campus alive with their foot tapping and soul swaying music. 
            Also on the agenda are the various literary competitions split up between English, Hindi 
            and Tamil along with the cultural and arts events.
